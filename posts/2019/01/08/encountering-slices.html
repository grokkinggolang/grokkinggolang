      <h1>Encountering Slices</h1>
<p class="subtitle">January 8, 2019</p>

<p><span class="newthought"></span></p>

<p>Slices currently feel like the solution to a problem I’ve not yet felt the pain of.  That’s not to say the problem isn’t there; I’m just not aware of it yet.  Is this because in systems programming the data you’re close to and manipulate more is of a different kind?  Or of a different structure? Or more unpredictable? Or more raw? Or is performance more a concern from the outset? I guess I’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>For my learning purposes, what follows is a series of facts and musings about them, strung together in some kind of train-of-thought type structure;</p>

<p>Literals are initialised without a size (unlike array literals).</p>

<p>They can extend (within the cap).</p>

<p>They’re not comparable out of the box (so we can’t use <code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code>).  While the standard golang libraries provide a function to compare byte slices thats the only one; the rest you need to build yourself.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Is this because the rest aren’t that frequently needed? I’ll have to wait and find out.</span></p>

<p>Digging into why you can’t directly compare them is instructive. Firstly;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike array elements, the elements of a slice are indirect, making it possible for a slice to contain pointers to contain itself. <cite>The Go Programming Language (2016), Donovan and Ritchie, pp. 87</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And secondly;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>because slice elements are indirect, a fixed slice may contain different elements at different times as the content of the underlying array are modified. <cite>The Go Programming Language (2016), Donovan and Ritchie, pp. 87</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s be explicit about what “indirect” is.  Slices are like windows onto a subset of an underlying data type - an Array.  Without Arrays they don’t exist. They don’t have any storage themselves - they just contain a pointers to an Array - and then add on characteristics such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">len</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cap</code>.</p>

<p>It may be instructive at this point to bring in some ways of categorising things.</p>

<p><em>Composite types</em> are types created by combining the basic types (Integers, String etc.) in various ways.</p>

<p>Arrays (and Structs) are a subset of Composite Type, called <em>Aggregate Types</em> . They are concatenations of other values in memory.</p>

<p>Slices, while they are Composite Types are not Aggregate Types, and must have zero or one underlying Array type behind them. If a Slice has no underlying Array type then checking against <code class="highlighter-rouge">nil</code> with the comparison operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code> (the only usage of this operator valid for Slices) will return <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>.  This is the zero-value of Slices.</p>

<p>A slice can still be empty if it has an underlying array, but the <code class="highlighter-rouge">len</code> will then be zero.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To use slices directly its important to bear in mind that although the elements of the underlying array are indirect , the slices pointer, <code class="highlighter-rouge">len</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cap</code> are not. <cite>The Go Programming Language (2016), Donovan and Ritchie, pp. 91</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which leads me to a question which I intend to explore in a later post; do slices need to point to contiguous elements of their undelying array? <label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I assume so, but it’s always best never to assume I’ve found.</span></p>

<h3 id="addendum">Addendum</h3>
<p>Slices can be used to implement stacks. But why not just have a Stack data type?  It seems strange coming from the Java language with such a rich set of collections types, to arrive in goland [sic] where I find myself with just a pen knife and a compass.  It’s different, but thats why I’m here; to find out why.</p>
