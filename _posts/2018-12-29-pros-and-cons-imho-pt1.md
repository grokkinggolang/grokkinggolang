## Pros
There is only one right way to do things, enforced by `gofmt`.

It is very much a toolchain and a platform as well as a language.  

## Cons
IDE support is really nascent - time to learn EMACS (finally).

Installation feels really complicated (coming from a Java background) and [Ben Boyter agrees with me.](https://boyter.org/posts/how-to-start-go-project-2018/)
